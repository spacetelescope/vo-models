        Enumeration of possible phases of job execution

        PENDING: The first phase a job is entered into - this is where
              a job is being set up but no request to run has
              occurred.

        QUEUED: A job has been accepted for execution but is waiting
              in a queue

        EXECUTING: A job is running

        COMPLETED: A job has completed successfully

        ERROR: Some form of error has occurred

        UNKNOWN: The job is in an unknown state.

        HELD: The job is HELD pending execution and will not
              automatically be executed - can occur after a
              PHASE=RUN request has been made (cf PENDING).

        SUSPENDED: The job has been suspended by the system during
              execution

        ABORTED: The job has been aborted, either by user request or by
              the server because of lack or overuse of resources.

        ARCHIVED: The job has been archived by the server at destruction time. An archived job
              may have deleted the results to reclaim resources, but must have job metadata preserved.
              This is an alternative that the server may choose in contrast to completely destroying all record of the job.

            If this attribute is true then the
            content of the parameter represents a URL to retrieve the
            actual parameter value.

            It is up to the implementation to decide
            if a parameter value cannot be returned directly as the
            content - the basic rule is that the representation of
            the parameter must allow the whole job element to be
            valid XML. If this cannot be achieved then the parameter
            value must be returned by reference.
